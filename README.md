## Intro

_Welcome friend... Welcome..._ This right here are the dotfiles for my Pop!_OS install.

#### What the ... is a dotfile?!

Well, to explain better, I have to go back in time. Bun not too much. Let me tell you a little story...

Once upon a time there was an operating system being developed: __UNIX__. Because in the unix world the current directory is `.` and the previous one is `..`, in an attempt to avoid listing them, all files starting with a __dot__ in front of the namewere ignore, thus becomming hidden.

One day a user showed up and he wanted to have his apps behave in the way he wanted, so the mighty devs said:

> Very well, you shall have means of modifying them apps.

So they made the settings of the apps accessible from files in each user's home directory and because they were so many, they were made hidden, not to disturb the user.

_The end!_
